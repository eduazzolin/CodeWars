TITLE:
Title Case

DESCRIPTION:
A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string is either
(a) capitalised (that is, only the first letter of the word is in upper case)
or (b) considered to be an exception and put entirely into lower case unless it
 is the first word, which is always capitalised.

Write a function that will convert a string into title case, given an optional
list of exceptions (minor words). The list of minor words will be given as a
string with each word separated by a space. Your function should ignore the
case of the minor words string -- it should behave in the same way even if
the case of the minor word string is changed.

Arguments
First argument (required): the original string to be converted.
Second argument (optional): space-delimited list of minor words that must always
be lowercase except for the first word in the string. The JavaScript/CoffeeScript
tests will pass undefined when this argument is unused.

Example
title_case('a clash of KINGS', 'a an the of') # should return: 'A Clash of Kings'
title_case('THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS', 'The In') # should return: 'The Wind in the Willows'
title_case('the quick brown fox') # should return: 'The Quick Brown Fox'
